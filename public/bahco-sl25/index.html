        <h2>Bahco SL25 &frac14; Inch Socket Set</h2>
        <p>
            Some tools just ooze quality. You know when you can just <em>tell</em> from the satin finish
            on the steel that you've got your money's worth? That's what the Bahco SL25 &frac14; inch socket set is like.
        </p>
        
        <h3>What You Get</h3>
        <p>
           It&#8217;s a small set, but that's part of its appeal. I&#8217;ve got a whopping great big socket
           set that I can barely lift, but what I really needed was a set I could carry with me.
           Packed into a rugged, bright orange case that&#8217;s only 160x85x35mm (LxWxH), the Bahco fills
           that particular niche really rather well.
        </p>
        <p>
           For a not-so-whopping &pound;19.50 (although admittedly that was the on-sale price) you get:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>A beautiful, stubby &frac14; inch ratchet handle</li>
            <li>A long, slender extension bar</li>
            <li>4, 4.5, 5, 5.5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12 &amp; 13mm sockets</li>
            <li>T10, T15, T20, T25, T30 &amp; T40 Torx bits</li>
            <li>Two PH2 Phillips bits</li>
            <li>5 &amp; 6mm hex bits</li>
            <li>A bit adaptor for the Torx, Phillips and hex bits</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Not a bad assortment by any means. I especially like the subtle admission that Phillips drivers
            and screws are rubbish and you&#8217;re going to need two of them &mdash; at least.

            Isn&#8217;t it <em>sweet</em>?
        </p>

        <h3>The Ratchet Handle &amp; Sockets</h3>
        <p>
            The ratchet handle is short; it has to be to fit in that little case. It means you can&#8217;t apply
            much torque to it, but that&#8217;s probably a good thing for a &frac14; inch drive &mdash; there&#8217;s
            a good reason no-one sells &frac14; inch breaker bars.
            The handle is a nice shape and has a rubber, non-slip coating that feels good in the hand.
            The ratchet mechanism itself is quite fine and has a very positive click to it; and the direction
            reversal mechanism is easy to flick from one side to the other without feeling like
            you might do it accidentally.
        </p>
        <p>
            When the release button is pressed the sockets pop on and off the handle with a satisfying 'clunk', and feel
            very firmly held in place the rest of the time. When using the extension bar the sockets have a little
            more play in them, but that can sometimes be of help when trying to line them up with a bolt or nut in
            a tight space.
        </p>
        <img src="/bahco-sl25/ratchet.jpg" class="review" alt="A 10mm socket, 3 Torx bits, and a ratchet handle">
        <p>
            The sockets themselves share the same lovely satin finish as the rest of the set, with a slight knurl
            on the handle side. On all the bolt-heads and nuts I&#8217;ve tested against the fit has been about right for my
            tastes: not so tight that my nuts get stuck, but not a great deal of slop either. Unlike some cheaper sockets
            I&#8217;ve used there&#8217;s a reasonably convex surface to the 'flats' of the sockets. That&#8217;s great, because it
            means the socket grips the flats of the bolt head more than the corners &mdash; and gripping the corners instead is a great
            way to round them off.
        </p>


        <h2>The Case</h2>
        <p>
            The case is actually one of my favourite things about this set. So many tool sets seem to assume
            you&8217;re going to chuck the case anyway.
